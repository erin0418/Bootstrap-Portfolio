                        <p>Hi, my name is Erin! I am currently 26 years old and live in Brick, NJ. I am getting married in December so I will be changing my last name to Burns, but for a few more months I am still Erin Farrell. I first met my fiancé, Joe, in 8th grade. We have been together even since. Today me and my fiancé have a puppy and a cat that live with us. My puppy is a 2 year old Siberian Husky named Nymeria and my cat is a Calico cat named Khaleesi who we have had for 6 years now. </p>
                        <p>I have had a long travel to get to where I am today. After graduating high school, I spent a year at Penn State pursuing a degree in science. I realized quickly that was not for me (even though they had great ice cream) and moved back to New Jersey to go to Rutgers and received a B.A. in Psychology. From there I jumped into the buisness end of jobs. I worked as an office assisstant at a doctors office, a shift mananger at Pizza Hut, and now today as an office manager.</p>

                    <div class="col-md-12">
                        <p>Right now as office manager I work at an after school tutoring center called Math Genie. There I am the manager of the East Brunswick location running all daily operations. While there I started working on developing the company's website into the site it is today. This included redesigning not only the athsetics that the customers see, but also what the search engine sees. In doing this, I once again became interested in coding as a profession as well as a passion.</p>
                        <p>Completing this coding bootcamp while working full time will definitely be a challenge. Overall, I am a very ambitious person, so will make sure to balance my schedule accordingly. Whenever I sit down to code I see it more as enjoyable and fun than a chore. I hope you enjoy the rest of the site and my <a href=portfolio.html>portfolio</a> items!</p>
